# LoLdle - League of Legends Data

This project aimed at extending the League of Legends data by fetching additional information not available through the official LoL API. This includes details like release date, gender, and region of a champion.

## Automatic Generated Data File

An automatically generated data file is provided: [champions.json](https://gist.github.com/Kerrders/0067d88dfd982c272e20dcb496f4dbc7)

Feel free to use it.

## How to Use

1. Use the [champions.json](https://gist.github.com/Kerrders/0067d88dfd982c272e20dcb496f4dbc7) file for extra champion data.
2. Integrate the data into your application or project as needed.

## Contributing

If you have additional data or improvements to suggest, feel free to contribute to the project. Follow the standard GitHub flow by creating a fork, making changes, and submitting a pull request.

## Inspiration

The way of fetching data drew inspiration from [lassesuomela](https://github.com/lassesuomela) who came up with the idea of calculating the gender for example.
